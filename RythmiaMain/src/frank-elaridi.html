      <p>Covering everything from Syrian refugee camps to the Academy Awards, Frank Elaridi is a 4-time Emmy-Award-Winning Journalist who became a highly-sought-after celebrity healer with an emphasis on clearing trapped emotions and subconscious blocks keeping people stuck in old patterns and not having the careers, relationships, and health they want.</p>
        <p>His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/frankelaridi">YouTube channel</a> is centered around wellness and spirituality. There, viewers can learn about people who have activated their pineal gland or “third eye” and can still see even when completely blindfolded, watch the "real-life Thor" taking a DNA test, follow along during some of Frank’s own experiences with plant medicines like ayahuasca, learn about stem cell treatments, and go on adventures like the time he and his friends destroyed the things they were attached to!</p>
      <p>Frank is the co-author of the Modern Nirvana Oracle Deck, published by Chronicle Books. A sensory experience inspired by avant-garde '80s fashion, The Modern Nirvana Oracle Deck includes a guidebook and 50 beautifully illustrated cards. Each card provides an inspiring quote, ageless wisdom for our modern lives, breathwork and meditations, and a mantra designed to further activate the intentions within the cards.

        <h3>
          CODES FOR HEALING FROM PAST TRAUMAS
        </h3>
        <p>Within all of us is a little child who just wants to feel that they are loved and protected. Traumas from our past, and we all have them, may be forgotten, but they unconsciously show up in our relationships, our careers, families, and other areas of life. We’re going to discuss a couple of ways to work on healing that inner child through meditation, guided plant medicine journeys, and “the emotion code.”

  <p>We will begin with a group meditation I picked up from different teachers including Deepak Chopra. From a more centered place, we will go into the following…</p>
  <p>Healing trauma of all kinds (some you aren’t even aware of) can happen in many ways. We will have a discussion about the psychoactive brew ayahuasca and anecdotal experiences I’ve documented on <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQgVarRGrboDQF9iBb6py5Ob7LKZ6j6g">YouTube.</a></p>
  <p>Learn about the emotion code (I’m a certified practitioner), described by Tony Robbins and Dr. Joe Dispenza as a powerful healing modality.</p>
  <p>The Emotion Code shows us that a broad spectrum of trapped emotions can be stored in different parts of our bodies–limiting the expression of health– and also provides the practical tools to free ourselves from the chains of those self-limiting emotions.</p>
  <p>You often aren’t aware of how much you were carrying and how much it was affecting your life until you let it go.</p>
  <p>We will do a live demo with members of the audience who would like to release trapped emotions regarding a certain life event, general blocks, or anything that is not serving them during their plant ceremonies.</p>
