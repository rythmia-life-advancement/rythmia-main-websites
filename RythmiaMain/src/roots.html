<h1>ROOTS RESTAURANT SCHEDULE*</h1>
<h2>BREAKFAST: 7:00 – 9:30 a.m.</h2>
<p>This is not your typical continental breakfast! We have hot and cold offerings that span far beyond the standard fare. Enjoy an array of fresh tropical fruit, local goats milk yogurt, superfood smoothies, or chia seed porridge. For something a little heartier, we offer a daily rotation of traditional breakfast options like muffins (vegan and gluten-free!), eggs, roast potatoes, oatmeal, and pancakes too! And we cant forget “gallo pinto”, the local rice and bean dish, a staple in the Tico (Costa Rican) diet!</p>
<br>
<h2>LUNCH: 12:00 – 2:30 p.m.</h2>
<br>
<h2>DINNER: 6:00 – 8:30 p.m.</h2>
  <p>We know that everyBODY has unique culinary needs, likes, and dislikes. And we have developed our daily menus with that top of mind, while also aiming to maintain harmony within the plant medicine, cleanse and health programs here at Rythmia. With a focus on high-frequency plant food, our lunch and dinner menus are structured with options for all: a colorful and abundant salad bar alongside, a creative and comforting hot buffet.</p>
<p>Our high vibration cold buffet always offers an abundance of fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, house-made dressings, and a rotating list of specialized composed salads and raw food creations.
  There is always a hot soup on offer, anything from roasted tomato & red pepper, to curried carrot or broccoli and mint. This is a great option for those enjoying the juice program and wishing to maintain a more liquid diet while staying with us.</p>
<p>For a more grounding, warming meal, head to the hot buffet, where you will always find a selection of simply prepared ingredients, perfect for those strictly adhering to the plant medicine diet. Kitchari, a healing Ayurvedic combination of rice, lentils, and spices is also a daily inclusion. To balance the meal out, we have a seemingly endless list of other options like sweet potato curry, vegetarian and chicken quesadillas, white bean burgers, eggplant tacos, cajun style fish fillets, or chickpea crust pizzas.
</p>
<p>And what would a meal be, if not for a sweet ending? The cold buffet is also home to fruit salad, as well as tasty morsels like chocolate chunk cookies, carrot cake bliss balls, vegan chocolate pudding, and more!</p>

      <br>
      <p>Meg is an intuitive eater and chef, passionate plant-pusher and food philosopher, yoga instructor, inspirational speaker, retired television director, cookbook author, and eating disorder awareness advocate, with a personal mission to make the world a sweeter place, filled with love.</p>
      <p>Meg is a certified Professional Plant-Based and Living Food Chef, food educator, and Culinary Nutrition Expert. Meg has also studied personally with raw food detox expert Natalia Rose at the Natalia Rose Institute in New York City as well as at Matthew Kenneys M.A.K.E. Culinary Academy in Santa Monica, California.</p>
    <p>Having worked in restaurants and the food industry off and on for two decades and having grown up in her mother’s creative kitchen on a small farm in rural Ontario, Canada where meals were often based around local produce and comprised of comfort fare, Meg was surrounded with love from a strong family with hearty and healthy food philosophy. Even so, as a young adult, Meg fought some serious food battles, suffering from anorexia and bulimia in her early teens. Over a decade of alcoholism, addiction and depression followed.</p>
    <p>After overcoming a series of life-altering events in 2010 and 2011 that included the loss of her father to ALS, a personal bankruptcy, a failed engagement, and her own relapse in bulimia that resulted in a near-death emergency room visit, Meg chose to take the leap and leave her 12-year career in live television production to pursue her passions: raw food & yoga. During recovery from her eating disorder and grief, she found comfort and strength in adopting a whole foods diet and also great satisfaction in being able to share her affection for food creativity with others.</p>

    <p>After spending several years sharing her knowledge and expertise in her longtime home of Toronto, in 2013 Meg packed her bags and moved to Costa Rica, where she built a business catering wellness retreats, offering private chef services, and consulting with restaurants. Meg joined the Rythmia team in 2016 and feels blessed to share what her journey has taught her about nutrition, self-love, and healing the body and soul through conscious cuisine.</p>
