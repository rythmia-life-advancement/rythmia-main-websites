      </p><p>As a spiritual leader, Dr. Beckwith has always taught about the unity of humanity and that of all life, including protecting the sanctity and preciousness of Mother Earth: “We are to be responsible stewards for the earth, and during this time of climate change, we must reduce our carbon footprint, protect the rainforests, plant more trees and take a stand for Mother Earth as if our lives depend on it because they do.”</p>
      <p>Three of his books—Life Visioning, Spiritual Liberation, and TranscenDance Expanded—have received the prestigious Nautilus Award. His app, Beckwith Inspires, features essential spiritual tools, technologies, and practices to help shift perceptions and transform lives.

          The Answer is You
        </h3>
        <p>Beckwith deeply explores his acclaimed teachings on life visioning, prosperity, abundance, and living from the overflow. Through awareness technology, spiritual practices, intentionality, and dedication, we can take back our minds and use them as an avenue of awareness rather than as a dumping ground for errant thoughts and perceptions that run rampant in the world masquerading as Reality. When we have successfully taken back our mind, it becomes a powerful and useful tool for our own evolution, for expressing happiness and prosperity, and for living a purposeful life!
        </p>
        <p>There is a difference between the Divine Mind, which are all individualized expressions, and the programmed, egoic mind. In this course, we will become more in tune with the Divine Mind, which gives us access to our intuition, which in turn allows us access to our “inner knower” so that we can live our life’s purpose.
        </p>
        <p>By understanding the workings of the mind, we learn how to remain conscious without falling prey to the downward spiral of negative thinking. You become aware that you are pure awareness itself, that you can transmute and transcend those programs that cause you to go through life with the breaks on. This workshop will provide you with the framework necessary to hold and stabilize spiritual insight and transmute fears and mental and emotional blockages. By entering into teachings, exercises, processes, and spiritual practices–including meditation, affirmative prayer, and visioning–we will take back and reprogram our minds, become aware that we are awareness, and live to our fullest potential!
