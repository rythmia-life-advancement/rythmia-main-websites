        <h3>
          THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF GRACE
        </h3>
        <p>Grace comes alive as you learn to surrender. This is not the same as collapsing, passivity, or self-rejection. Grace dances with your trust, honesty, devotion, curiosity, compassion, humility, willingness, and patience – so that your ego can let go of the reigns. Relax the grip of fear and control. Simply be present with what is.</p>

Your answer to this powerful invitation will enable you to open beyond concept into a more direct experience of the Divine Presence.</p>
