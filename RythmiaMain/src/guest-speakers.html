        <p>
          Within all of us is a little child who just wants to feel that they
          are loved and protected. Traumas from our past, and we all have them,
          may be forgotten, but they unconsciously show up in our relationships,
          our careers, families, and other areas of life. We’re going to discuss
          a couple of ways to work on healing that inner child through
          meditation, guided plant medicine journeys, and “the emotion code”
        </p>
        <p>
          We will begin with a group meditation I picked up from different
          teachers including Deepak Chopra. From a more centered place, we will
          go into the following…
        </p>
        <p>
          Healing trauma of all kinds (some you aren’t even aware of) can happen
          in many ways. We will have a discussion about the psychoactive brew
          ayahuasca and anecdotal experiences I’ve documented on

          SHADOW WORK 101: HOW TO EFFECTIVELY FACE YOUR INNER DEMONS & HEAL YOUR
          PAIN
        </p>
        <p>
          Learn what your “shadow” actually is, how it negatively affects all
          areas of your life, and some powerful tips to help you do shadow work
          effectively. On the journey of awakening, one must eventually come
          face to face with the aspects of ourselves that are hidden and buried
          deep within us. Without this conscious awareness, we cannot truly heal
          and release our past in order to move into a happier future. But for
          so many of us, confronting our “demons” feels scary and impossible, as
          if our pain were somehow stronger than our ability to heal.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this workshop, you’ll learn how to become aware of what’s known as
          “your shadow” and how to heal it in a spiritually mature way, without
          bypassing. You’ll also discover how plant medicine can accelerate your
          shadow work and how to effectively use your ceremonies as catalysts
          for healing your shadow.

          We are a technology-based society, and our lives move fast along the
          information highway. The screens before us occupy massive amounts of
          time each day of our lives. Yet inside of each of us resides a

          the world. In this time of human history, it is vital for our inner
          technology, the path of spiritual wisdom, to be activated and engaged
          in our daily affairs. To create a balanced world, we as awakened
          beings can choose to live with full access to inner and outer
          technology and create a world that honors all.

No more worry, self-doubt, judgment, fear, or insecurities. A wonderful goal, but is it even possible?

      <p class="caption">THE ANSWER IS YOU</p>
      <p>
        Beckwith deeply explores his acclaimed teachings on life visioning, prosperity, abundance, and living from the overflow. Through awareness technology, spiritual practices, intentionality, and dedication, we can take back our minds and use them as an avenue of awareness rather than as a dumping ground for errant thoughts and perceptions that run rampant in the world masquerading as Reality. When we have successfully taken back our mind, it becomes a powerful and useful tool for our own evolution, for expressing happiness and prosperity, and for living a purposeful life!

        The law of attraction is one of the most important universal laws. And quantum physics is now helping us understand the science behind what was previously only known intuitively. In this seminar and experiential workshop, you will learn the latest information about how and why the powerful law works, and the most effective techniques for how to work in harmony with it to more easily manifest whatever you want in any area of your life – financial, relationships, health, happiness, professional success and social impact.
