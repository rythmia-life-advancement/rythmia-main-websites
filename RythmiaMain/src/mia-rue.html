        Meet Mia Rue Robbins
      </h1>

      <p>With over twenty-six years of immersive personal transformation and holistic life advancement training and experience, and several credentials including a Master’s Degree in Spiritual Psychology, Mia brings an abundance of resources and tools to facilitate rapid shifts in those she works with expanding awareness of what is possible and empowering evolution through education and experiential processes.</p>
          <p>For twenty years, Mia was a pioneer in the field of western entheogenic plant use (or plant medicine use). She was a researcher and member of the Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal, was asked to produce a documentary for the group and travel with, translate for, and document teachings of the elders of this community.</p>
            <p>She was granted permission to write two theses about the closed Hoasca religious society. These texts were later seized by the Attorney General of the United States and utilized as evidence in a six year legal struggle that culminated in Mia sitting before the Supreme Court of the United States where the group received a unanimous decision to receive legal protections to practice their ceremonies in the United States under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Since her departure from this group in 2011, she has diligently worked to study and develop holistic alternatives to accessing and sustaining personal transformation and spiritual evolution.</p>
            <p> Through individual and group work, Mia supports people in accessing their innate abilities to augment their cognitive and perceptory capabilities for their own positive advancement. Breathwork and the practices of Spiritual Psychology, in conjunction with holistic wellness practices, have been the most powerful tools for consistently achieving remarkable results that she has encountered.  Mia was introduced to breathwork through Rebirthing by Leonard Orr in the 1990s, and advanced her education through the Holotropic breathwork of Stanislov Groff, by his trained practitioners, and more recently with Wim Hof personally, as well as with Christian Minson through Transformational Breath and the breathwork that has evolved at Rythmia Life Advancement Center.
              </p>
            <p>Mia has decades of practical experience creating curriculum, educating internationally, serving in roles of leadership, maintaining a private practice, and is a Founding Partner of Rythmia Life Advancement Center.</p>

  <p>Process: Addressing the “Hot Topic” and Creating an Ideal Vision
    Deciphering Guidance and Taking Next Best Steps
    Process: Developing a Practice with Rythmia as the Testing Ground</p>
<p>Northing is the process by which we continually orient to the leading or guiding value that is our “True North.” Facilitator guides participants through processes that reveal this to themselves and shows how, through one’s own feelings, perceptions, and magnetizing to this “compass needle,” we are able to naturally determine when we are on course, when we are off course, and how to get back on track.</p>
<p>Participants use this skill in application to an area of their own life requiring attention, and develop a clear vision for what is ideally desired. They are then given guidelines for evaluating choices and supported in examining next best steps utilizing the skill sets taught.</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to develop a practice and shown how their time and opportunities for personal transformation at Rythmia Life Advancement Center provide the perfect testing ground for this.</p>
