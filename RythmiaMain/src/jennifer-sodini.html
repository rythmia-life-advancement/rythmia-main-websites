        Meet Jennifer Sodini
      </h1>
      
      <p>Jennifer Sodini is an eclectic entrepreneur based on the East Coast. The term eclectic by definition means deriving ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources; that description merely scratches the surface of where Jennifers inspirations and multifaceted abilities come from.</p>
          <p>In March of 2013 she founded the website EvolveandAscend.com, which inspires conscious evolution by questioning our current reality and exploring esoteric philosophy, and spirituality.</p>
            <p>Jennifer is a contributing writer to many top conscious media platforms, such as <a href="http://www.watkinsmagazine.com/a-beginners-guide-to-decoding-esoteric-symbolism-in-film"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watkins Magazine</span></i></a>, <a href="http://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/the-art-of-tarot-create-your-ideal-future/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conscious Lifestyle Magazine</span></i></a>, <a href="https://www.collective-evolution.com/author/weareevolveandascend/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collective Evolution</span></i></a>, <i>DMT: The Spirit Molecule</i>, and <i>The Know Culture</i>.</p>
            <p>Her modern adaptation of the Seven Hermetic Principles went viral on Facebook, receiving over 2 million views.</p>
            <p>Jennifer consults with many conscious media brands seeking to develop their digital presence and grow highly engaged online communities focused on the mind, body and spirit.</p>
            <p>Jennifer has an innate gift to perceive beyond what is visibly seen. A born psychic and spiritual intuitive, Jennifer has provided oracle card/psychic readings for thousands of people, hosted workshops on “Unlocking Your Psychic Potential”, and given talks about the dynamic between creativity/spirituality at events across the United States such as WITMA, SoulCamp, Rise Gatherings, Lucidity Festival, PEX, Gratitude*NYC, and East Meets West.</p>
            <p>Her work in this realm helped inspire the Brown Magick oracle card deck, and Jennifer appeared in an episode of Season 23 of America’s Next Top Model, where she provided oracle card readings for Drew Elliott from Paper Magazine, and the final contestants.</p>
            <p>Jennifer’s own oracle deck (and accompanying guide book), Amenti Oracle Feather Heart Deck and Guide Book: Ancient Wisdom for the Modern World, will be published by Running Press in Spring of 2019.</p>

        <h3>
          UNLOCKING YOUR INTUITION
        </h3>
        <p>This workshop aims to teach students that it is our birth-rite to be psychic by exploring the mystery of the pineal gland in relation to ancient knowledge and discuss the role that intuition plays in experiencing a mystical reality.</p>
<p>By showing different tools, exercises and methods to help flex this muscle, participants will learn how to unlock their highest potential. We will review all types of psychics (clairvoyant, clairsentient, etc.), as well as review different types of divination tools for reading others. Participants will also have a chance to apply the knowledge learned and conduct readings on one another at the end of our workshop.</p>
