        Meet Christian De La Huerta
      </h1>
     
      <p>For more than 25 years, Christian de la Huerta has been dedicated to facilitating personal transformation. An award-winning author, Christian is a respected teacher and sought-after speaker whose unique self-development programs have been experienced across the country in university lecture halls, non-profit headquarters, houses of worship, corporate boardrooms and private homes.

            <p>His role can be described in a variety of ways: leadership consultant, group facilitator, couples therapist, spiritual coach and beyond. But although his dedication manifests in a variety of ways for an incredibly diverse audience, all of Christian’s work shares a common result: profound personal transformation. Author of the award-winning and critically-acclaimed “Coming out Spiritually,” he is currently working on a new book “Soulful Power.”  More about his work may be found at <a href="http://www.soulfulpower.com/">www.SoulfulPower.com.</a></p>
