      <p>Dr. Jamie Turndorf is known to millions as Dr. Love, through her website AskDrLove.com–the web’s first and immensely popular relationship advice site since 1995.
        </p>
          <p>Dr. Turndorf’s life took a shocking turn 10 years ago, when her beloved husband, Emile Jean Pin (who the Dalai Lama named as one of the 50 men of all time who was one with God) died in her arms while they were vacationing together in Italy.
            </p>
            <p>Her husband’s astonishing manifestations, often in front of witnesses, proved to her that we don’t die, and our relationships aren’t meant to end with bodily death. She tells her amazing story and introduces her new grief therapy method in her no. 1 international bestseller, Love Never Dies: How to Reconnect and Make Peace with the Deceased, which has been translated into 34 languages.</p>
            <p>For the past 2.5 years, her Love Never Dies radio show has been number 1 on the Hay House radio network, surpassing the shows of spiritual giants like James Van Praagh, Wayne Dyer and Caroline Myss.</p>

        <h3>
          LOVE NEVER DIES: HOW TO RECONNECT AND MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR LOST LOVED ONE
        </h3>
        <p>If you can’t stop grieving over the bodily loss of the love of your life…
           </p>
           <p>The reason is surprisingly simple…</p>
          <p>You aren’t meant to be separated from those you love!
            And, reconnecting and staying connected is the only way to turn off the tears and transform your grief to joy.</p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>
<br>
<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>In her Love Never Dies Workshop–based on her number one international bestselling Hay House book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Never-Dies-Reconnect-Deceased/dp/140194535X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1466703765&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=love+never+dies+book">Love Never Dies: How to Reconnect and Make Peace with the Deceased</a>– Dr. Jamie Turndorf shares her amazing love story for the ages with her husband, Emile Jean Pin, whose astonishing after-death manifestations proved to her that we don’t die and our relationships aren’t meant to end with bodily death.</p>
<p>To honor his request to “let our love shine like a torch that lights the path for others,” Dr. Turndorf has created her Trans-Dimensional grief therapy method–a paradigm shift aimed at revolutionizing the Western approach to death and dying (grieve, let go and move on, which only leaves the bereaved at a greater loss).</p>
<p>Instead, she teaches you to tune to the “spirit channel” to say hello, not goodbye, to loved ones in spirit, so you can send and receive energetic communications, obtain guidance, and even heal unfinished business with any being in spirit–without the assistance of a medium channeler or psychic!</p>
<p><b>The Love Never Dies Workshop will teach you:</b>
</br>How to recognize all the ways that those in spirit reach out to you through dreams, mind melding (aka thought induction) and through a nearly infinite array of signs.</p>
<p>How spirit communicates with you through Open Vessels (people who are particularly open to spirit) and animals — domestic and wild –because they are what Dr. Turndorf calls natural Open Vessels.</p>
<p>How loved ones in spirit communicate using Earthly Props, which are electronic devices such as electric lights, computers and telephones.</p>
<p>After this, you will learn how to overcome the false beliefs and religious teachings that block you from reconnecting with your loved ones in spirit.</p>
<p>The first obstacle to overcome is the false belief that many Christians have been taught that we aren’t supposed to reconnect with those in spirit. To rebut this belief, Dr. Turndorf reveals her husband’s stunning after-death communication that proves what we’ve been told about the afterlife is dead wrong, including his shattering biblical reference proving that the bible actually instructs us to reconnect and stay connected with those in spirit!</p>
<p>Next, to help attendees understand how spirit communication occurs, Dr. Turndorf links the latest quantum physics research proving that 95% of our universe is comprised of what’s called dark matter or dark energy with Einstein’s discovery that energy cannot be destroyed. To simplify, when we shed the turtle shell of our physical bodies, the energy of our souls simply moves into the dark matter.</p>
<p>As Dr. Turndorf shows, communicating with spirit is nothing more than sending and receiving energetic signals, which we all do on a daily basis. The ability to extend our energetic communications to those in spirit simply involves learning how to tune to what Dr. Turndorf calls the “Spirit Channel” of our brains.</p>
<p><b>To access the Spirit Channel, Dr. Turndorf shows you:</b></p>
<p>-How to Create a State of Receptivity through what she calls Pockets of Peace Moments.</p>
<p>-How to breathe in order to invite spirit in, the right way to pray, how to surrender to your emotional states without allowing your emotions to wash you overboard, and how to harness the power of nature and twilight states–the time just before sleep and just upon awakening.</p>
<p>-How to heighten the five senses. This is vital as spirit is constantly sending signs to all of our senses. The more open our senses are, the more we can perceive the signs that spirits are sending us all the time.</p>
<p>-How to recognize the signs of spirit presence your life. Using examples from life with her husband in spirit, Dr. Turndorf shares the myriad signs of spirit presence. For many, just becoming aware of the signs is sufficient to begin the process of reconnecting.</p>
<p>At this point, you will discover the most revolutionary aspect of the Love Never Dies method–learning to establish a back-and-forth, two-sided communication with spirit using her revolutionary Dialoguing with the Departed technique.</p>
<p>Dr. Turndorf will show how to use human and animal Open Vessels and Earthly Props in the form of electronic devices in order to facilitate back-and-forth dialogues, and also show you how to engage in two-sided oral and written dialogues in order to:</p>
<p>-Say farewell to the physical body (in the case that someone was ripped from you due to sudden accidental death or illness)</p>
<p>-Obtain support and guidance</p>
<p>And, finally, because Dr. Turndorf knows that traditional Western grief therapy offers us no way of resolving unfinished business that millions of people harbor toward those who have passed, her workshop culminates in guiding attendees to use her <i>Dialoguing with the Departed</i> technique to heal any unfinished business that remains, so true healing can take place.</p>
<p>As you will soon discover, you are not supposed to live in an emotional wasteland separated from those you love, waiting until you “die” and enter heaven in order to be reunited.</p>
<p>As Dr. Turndorf’s husband told her soon after his bodily departure, “Death is an illusion. There is a very thin veil between the realm where you are and the realm where I am.” And, most importantly, “Heaven is a state, not a place. Heaven is all around us. Heaven is here and now.” This is means that you are meant to reconnect and stay connected with your loved ones in spirit right now!</p>
<p>Working with Dr. Turndorf extends beyond a traditional “reading” with a medium. Dr. Turndorf is a highly sensitive, skilled doctor with 34 years of experience at helping people transform their lives. Her Love Never Dies workshop and Dialoguing with the Departed technique brings a radically new form of spiritual relationship therapy that will enable you to reconnect, heal unfinished business, dissolve your grief and transform every aspect of your life.</p>
