        Meet Ora Nadrich
      </h1>
     
      <p>Ora Nadrich is a certified Life Coach, certified Mindfulness Meditation teacher, and author of Says Who? How One Simple Question Can Change The Way You Think Forever.</p>
            <p>New York Times best-selling author, Marianne Williamson says, “Ora Nadrich is a treasure. Her voice bears the passion of her own experience; she’s able to reach deep into our hearts because she’s culled so much wisdom from her own. When she speaks, I listen; when she writes, I read it; when she gives advice, I heed it. Her sparkle and power are not to be missed.”</p>
            <p>Ora prides herself on not only having devised a method of self discovery and mindful practice that is simple, direct and applicable to everyone, but is also easy to understand and put to use. And, like brushing your teeth, can be done daily and take about as much time.</p>
            <p>Simplicity is her mantra. That philosophy forms the basis of, “Says Who?, in which Ora vividly illustrates and breaks down her simple, yet highly effective method, based on the principle that while we all face obstacles and negative thoughts in our lives, it is not enough to simply examine and be aware of them—we must question and challenge them in order to bring about true change.</p>
