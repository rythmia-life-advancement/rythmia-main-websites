      <p>Kelly is the writer, director, and producer of HEAL, a documentary feature about the mind-body connection and our bodys innate ability to heal.</p>
          <p>A Los Angeles native, she grew up in front of the camera acting on and off in commercials, TV, and film from the age of 7. In 2012 she started Elevative Entertainment with the intention to create conscious media that informs, inspires, and empowers.</p>
          <p>She has a passion for psychology, wellness, and spirituality and an insatiable appetite for understanding consciousness. As such, she has spent the last 18 years studying the teachings of luminaries like Eckhart Tolle, Marianne Williamson, Ernest Holmes, Wayne Dyer, Michael Beckwith and many more.</p>
          <p>Her passion for optimal wellness intensified after reading The Biology of Belief by Bruce Lipton, PhD and learning that we are not victims of our genes like we have been led to believe. It was around that time in 2008 that she felt a strong calling to do a film about the power and possibility of the mind-body connection. 8 years and many hours of research later, HEAL was made.</p>
          <p>Her intention with the documentary is to empower people to take back control of their health and demonstrate that anything is possible if we believe it is so. Kelly is a seeker, a meditator, and enjoys traveling, sports, reading and writing.</p>
