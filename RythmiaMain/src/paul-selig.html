        Meet Paul Selig
      </h1>
 
      <p>Paul Selig is considered to be one of the foremost spiritual channels working today. In his breakthrough works of channeled literature including I Am the Word and Beyond the Known: Realization, Paul Selig has recorded an extraordinary program for personal and planetary evolution as humankind awakens to its own divine nature.</p>
          <p>Paul was born in New York City and received his master’s degree from Yale. A noted educator, he served on the faculty of NYU for over 25 years and directed the MFA in Creative Writing Program at Goddard College. He now serves on the college’s Board of Trustees.</p>
            <p>A spiritual experience in 1987 left him clairvoyant. As a way to gain a context for what he was beginning to experience he studied different forms of energy healing before beginning to lead workshops internationally. Paul’s workshops have garnered a growing following and are praised for creating transformational breakthroughs and for creating a safe space for participants to form lifelong connections with fellow attendees.</p>
            <p>Paul’s work has been featured on ABC News Nightline, Fox News, New York Magazine, the Biography Channel series The UneXplained and the documentary film PGS: Your Personal Guidance System. He has appeared on numerous radio shows and podcasts including Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and Bob Olson’s Afterlife TV.</p>

<p><b>FROM RECENT WORKSHOP ATTENDEES:<b>
  <br><i>“There are no words that truly express the gratitude that I feel for the experience of this workshop. In my 25 years, I find this without a doubt to be the most humbling, liberating and life-changing experience, one that I will hold dear to my heart forever. Thank you, Paul, for all you do. You have changed the trajectory of my life for the amazing. I look forward to being in your presence/workshop, whenever that day may be. This will always be remembered as both, my favorite day of my life, and the one that helped me realize all that we are in Truth.” <b>— Austin Thul, Seattle</b></i>
</p>
<p><i>"Attending this workshop was truly amazing! Being a lifelong junkie of spiritual and self-help, I am much more selective and cautious now about where I go and who I listen to. I’ve been resonating deeply with the teachings from the Guides for some time now, so it was clear that I wanted to experience this ‘in person’. But what really stood out for me is the gift Paul himself brings to this…He is honest, vulnerable and just straight up REAL! What a gift and relief as I felt I had a friend who just gets the whole human aspect of it all. He gives us permission by just showing up like he does to learn, grow and be HERE in all our humanness, evolution, and truth. That, along with the energy and teachings that the Guides are bringing though…well, words limit the shift I am feeling ~ It is a gift beyond anything I can accurately express. Thank you so so much!” <b>— Jeanette Brynn, Seattle, WA</b>></i></p>
<p><i>“I so highly recommend coming to be with Paul and the guides “in person”. For me, just experiencing the energy in the room is worth it, but on top of that, the material that emerges and the attunements are exquisitely powerful and transformative. These workshops have brought this material to life for me in such a dynamic way so that the teachings have penetrated deeply into my being and my daily life. So much gets clarified in response to questions, or just as the day develops. I can hardly wait till I can do this again.”<b> – Natasha S.</b></i></p>
<p><i>“Paul likes to describe himself as “just the guy who sits in the chair,” but his finely-tuned abilities enable transmission of the highest level of teachings I’ve heard, and his kindness and compassion provide a safe, loving space for participants to fully receive the Guides’ wisdom. Watching Paul work psychically during the class is simultaneously fascinating, insightful, entertaining, and moving and, in my experience, remarkably accurate…Highly recommended.” —<b> Bill Hooper</b></i></p>
