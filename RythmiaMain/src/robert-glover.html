        <h3>
          HOW TO REALLY LOVE YOURSELF
        </h3>
        <p>It is the most basic human desire to love, be loved, and feel lovable.  Most of us spend our lives looking for love in all the wrong places and settling for cheap substitutes along the way. We have bought into the myths of romantic love and sought that one special person to complete us and satisfy our inner longings for acceptance and connection. </p>

<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>In all of this, we frequently come away feeling cheated, disappointed, and lonelier than when we began. For many, all we learn from love is how to defend ourselves from what we desire the most and shoot anybody who outdraws us.
  </p>
<p>In this two-part Rythmia presentation, Dr. Robert Glover, relationship expert and author, will share a simple, ages-old secret for finding lasting love. In the process, you will learn how to truly love yourself, love others, and open your heart to the love you desire.</p>
