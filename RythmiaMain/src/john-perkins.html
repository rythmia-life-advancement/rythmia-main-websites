        Meet John Perkins
      </h1>
      
      <p>John Perkins focuses on transformation – personal, communal, and global. His books have been on the New York Times bestseller list for more than 70 weeks, are published in over 30 languages, and have sold millions of copies.</p>
          <p>A leading authority on shamanism, he learned about the power of using perceived reality to change objective reality – shapeshifting – from ayahuasca shamans beginning in 1968 in the Amazon rain forest – where he was initiated as shaman. After that, he studied with shamans on five continents.</p>
            <p>He has used shamanic practices to help individuals, corporations, universities and governments. He was Chief Economist at a major international consulting firm where he advised the World</p>
            <p>Bank, United Nations, Fortune 500 corporations, and the US and other governments. He has lectured at Harvard, Oxford and more than 50 other universities; he has been featured on ABC, NBC, CNN, CNBC, NPR, A&E, the History Channel, and in Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Cosmopolitan, Elle, Der Spiegel, and many other publications.</p>
            <p>In addition to his Confessions of an Economic Hit Man and other nonfiction books on global intrigue, he has authored five books on indigenous cultures and transformation, including Shapeshifting.</p>
            <p>He is a founder of Dream Change and (along with Bill and Lynne Twist) the Pachamama Alliance, nonprofits dedicated to creating a regenerative, peaceful, and thriving world. He was awarded the Lennon Ono Grant for Peace, 2012.</p>

          PLANTS: TOUCHING THE JAGUAR WITH SHAPESHIFTING TEACHERS
        </h3>
        <p>Johns life was saved and forever changed by ayahuasca, deep in the Amazon rain forest in 1968. Like most people, he had never heard of ayahuasca at that time.</p>

  <p>“I learned”, he says,” that first night that plants have a consciousness and that, at this time of global crises, they are insisting on sharing it with us humans.</p>
<p>Plants teach us to alter objective reality by changing our perceptions of reality – by shapeshifting – making the impossible become possible. Just as a tiny seed breaks through cement, we can break through the cement that has held us in destructive patterns – individually and globally”.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #fc7138;">WORKSHOP BENEFIT:&nbsp;</span> John will describe how plants teach us to do what indigenous shamans refer to as touching the jaguar – confronting our obstacles, our blockages, and using the energy of those obstacles to realize our greatest potentials, follow our bliss, and rise to a higher level of consciousness. </p>
<p>He will take you on a shamanic journey deep into plant spirits where you will follow your soul to set priorities for your life; you will touch the jaguars that have held you back and now will empower and inspire you to move forward and act in ways that resonate with your higher consciousness.</p>
