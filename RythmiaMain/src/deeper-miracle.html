          A DEEPER MIRACLE
        </h3>
        <p>
          Experience a deeper miracle with a week of increased time dedicated to you. In lieu of a guest speaker this week, Gerry, John Jacob, Brad, Jeff and the entire shamanic staff get to devote more time to each client. This means more time for you to integrate and process your experience in a more personalized setting. We call it “A Deeper Miracle” because we have found that these weeks yield the highest miracle rate.

  <p>Through awareness technology, spiritual practices, intentionality and dedication, we can take back our mind and use it as an avenue of awareness, rather than as a dumping ground of errant thoughts and perceptions that run rampant in the world masquerading as Reality. When we have successfully taken back our mind, it becomes a powerful and useful tool for our own evolution, for expressing happiness and prosperity, and for living a purposeful life!
