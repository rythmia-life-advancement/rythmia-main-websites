        Meet Ivan and Lana Rados
      </h1>
     
      <p>Ivan and Lana have spent 28 years sharing their lives, loving each other, and overcoming life’s obstacles while learning from them. After working all this time in parallel, each with their own clients and in their own unique ways, the two healers have finally decided to embark on the next journey and combine their talents to life their healing powers to a truly cosmic level!
        </p>
          <p>Together, they have created 1, 3, and 5 day workshop for individuals, couples, and groups. Participants in these workshops are guided, both on a conscious and unconscious level, by these two master healers.

          CONSCIOUS RELATIONSHIPS
        </h3>
        <p>
          In this workshop, Ivan and Lana will offer a combination of lectures and experiential exercises. The lectures will focus on what constitutes a Conscious Relationship — interwoven with the story of Ivan and Lana’s own relationship – illustrating a journey from a relationship that was messy, broken, and immature to a highly evolved, harmonious, and conscious relationship.</p>

<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>You will find a deeper level of understanding and self-awareness that when combined with specific tools will propel you toward personal and consequential expansion and elevation.</p>
<p>
  The exercises are drawn from the techniques that Ivan and Lana have developed over time as a couple. Typically, partners see themselves as undeserving and unlovable, which is the source of their greatest fear and the main reason for lies, manipulation, and defensiveness.</p>
<p>When we have the courage and integrity to show the ugliest, most disowned parts of ourselves, with no hidden agenda, it allows our partner to see the true celestial beauty in us.</p>
