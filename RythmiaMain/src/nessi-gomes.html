        Meet Nessi Gomes
      </h1>
 
      <p>Born on the tiny island of Guernsey (UK), singing and music became Nessis way of dealing with challenging life circumstances. From a young age she discovered the ability to transform discomforts and unspoken emotions by exploring sound, and has continued to root herself more and more in the therapeutic value of sonic expression.</p>
          <p>Nessi’s creative turning point took place seven years ago upon settling in the community of PachaMama in Costa Rica. The nature of the place has reshaped and deepened her approach towards music, therapy and self-healing.</p>
          <p>In the past 4 years Nessi has shared her music and voice retreats in 25 countries. In October 2016 she released her debut album Diamonds & Demons and received Best of British Unsigned female artist for that year. Nessi Gomes is a musician with a BA in Creative Expressive Therapies in Music (Derby University, UK, 2008). She also has a Diploma with British Academy of Sound Therapy in Group Voice Therapy – Chichester, UK, 2015.</p>

        <h3>
          TASTE OF VOCAL ODYSSEY: MEETING WITH THE SPIRIT OF YOUR VOICE
        </h3>
        <p>The voice is our most intimate instrument and resource. Yet, often untapped and unexpressed.</p>

<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>In this workshop, we will explore the liberating healing powers of our own voices, the ability to come closer to ourselves, and to share fearlessly our truth and vulnerability at each moment. We will discover deeper self-love and acceptance; beyond ideas, limiting beliefs, judgments, concepts, rights, and wrongs.</p>
<p>In the past 7 years, Nessi and Lino have shared this sincere yet playful work in Europe, the Middle East, North, and Central America. It is often touching to witness the transformative joy and freedom that each one of us holds within his or her own vocal expression.</p>
<p>This workshop is for everybody, experienced singers as well as non-experienced. It is not about becoming a better singer but rather about connecting to our already perfect voice, to who we are. It is not about impressing anybody but rather about expressing that which is within us and waiting to be communicated.</p>
