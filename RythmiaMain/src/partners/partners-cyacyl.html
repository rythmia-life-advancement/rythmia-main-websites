  <div id="showMore7" style="display: none;">
    <p>Joan began her journey with what she calls a mid life “rebirth” when her 23-year marriage ended and her mother and sister passed away, all within a period of six months. Joan used the tremendous loss and personal pain she experienced as the catalyst to a new life. During a period of self-discovery, Joan came to understand that we are impacted by all aspects of life, and are not just the mind, body, soul or spirit, but a sum of the whole. She set out to provide information that connects the dots between these components and it is her goal to educate, inspire, motivate and empower others. She offers hope with her message about the power of positive thoughts and intentions, and she guides people on how to embrace and deal with change instead of fearing and hiding from it. Joan is passionate about giving back to society and helping others whenever possible. She coordinates charitable initiatives through her brand and is involved with various non-profit organizations and programs.</p>
