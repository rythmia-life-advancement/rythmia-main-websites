      <p>
        Kim Stanwood Terranova is a woman of passionate power that assists individuals with experiencing true inner
        greatness and unlimited, authentic joy. Kim has been dubbed the “mind chiropractor” and the master teacher of
        intentional living! Kim holds a license as a Practitioner of Truth from The Agape International Spiritual Center
        in Los Angeles, a Bachelor’s Degree in Spiritual Studies, and she is a facilitator at the Agape University for
        Transformational Studies as well as a teacher of Rev. Michael’s The Answer is You program.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has immersed herself in applying and practicing universal spiritual truth and wisdom for over three decades.
        Her work with powerful teachers such as Dr. Rev. Michael Beckwith, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Rhonda Britten,
        and Terry Cole Whitaker have empowered her to ignite a deep and profound awakening in all those she works with.
        Kim is the founder of Namaste’ Retreats, and she also founded a global peace organization called World As One
        with Rev. Michael on the board of directors. Through World As One, her intention is nothing short of awakening
        the children of the world with peace principles that honor all as global citizens. Kim’s commitment to all those
        who cross her path is to hold them in the highest light of knowing spiritual Truth for them while they awaken to
        their own greatness. Kim is a woman who empowers humanity.

      </p>
      <p>
        Kim participates as a counselor in the “Every 15 Minutes” program offered through the Malibu Unified School
        District (two-day event) to illuminate the devastating consequences of intoxicated or distracted driving. Her
        intention technology has been shared at various private schools in the southern California area and through an
        annual retreat in January hosted at the Namaste’ Sanctuary.
