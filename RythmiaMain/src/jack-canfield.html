        <h3>THE LAW OF ATTRACTION AND MANIFESTATION</h3>

        <p>
          The law of attraction is one of the most important universal laws. And
          quantum physics is now helping us understand the science behind what
          was previously only known intuitively. In this seminar and
          experiential workshop, you will learn the latest information about how
          and why the powerful law works, and the most effective techniques for
          how to work in harmony with it to more easily manifest whatever you
          want in any area of your life – financial, relationships, health,
          happiness, professional success and social impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll also explore why most people fail when they first try to
          intentionally work with the Law of Attraction, and how to overcome the
          blocks and traps that stop them. We’ll also look at how plant medicine
          journeys work to accelerate your success in living in harmony with the
          Law of Attraction to manifest what you truly want.
