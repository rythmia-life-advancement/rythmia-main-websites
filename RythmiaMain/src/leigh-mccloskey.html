The exploration and manifestation of creative consciousness is a skill set that can be developed, like learning how to cultivate inner characters as the actor does.

It will open the doors of perception to reveal the operating systems of psyche and soul and the many secret codes and languages that set the stage to trust and liberate your inner creator.</p>
