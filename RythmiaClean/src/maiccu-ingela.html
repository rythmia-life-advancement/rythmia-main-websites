        <h3>
          ANIMAL COMMUNICATION & SILENT HEALING
        </h3>
        <p>In this workshop we will dive deep into the importance of animals and their healing powers.</p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>
<br>
<div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>You will learn about animal’s profound messages to us humans and you will discover how to understand their magnificent silent language.</p>
<p>Animal communication is just like a different language and just as we learn to speak different language in school, we can also learn to talk with animals and nature.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what your pet or animal companion is thinking or feeling?</p>
<p>Do you ever feel the strong energy when you are around trees, plants, water or the wind?</p>
<p>During the workshop we will start tapping into the ability how to communicate with animals and learning about silent healing powers between species and nature.</p>
<p>In this workshop there will be a lot of aha moments, laughter and tears as we together go through these profound emotions and the awakening that animals bring out from inside of us. Somewhere along the way we have forgotten our mutual language, this is a way to sensitize our intuition to feel all those forgotten things, communication and healing.</p>
<p>This workshop is a very healing experience and we welcome you to join us on this journey.</p>
<p>Love,
<br>
  Maiccu & Ingela</p>
