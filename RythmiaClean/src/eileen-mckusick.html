      <p>Eileen Day McKusick, M.A. is a researcher, award-winning author and the founder of Biofield Tuning, a ground-breaking sound therapy modality.  Having spent over 20 years researching the electromagnetic field that surrounds the human body (the “biofield”), she has meticulously mapped the biofield, revealing the influence of magnetic fields on our physical, mental and emotional well being.  Biofield Tuning utilizes strategically applied sound waves on the body and in the biofield to achieve resolution of a wide variety of health conditions including  pain, digestive issues, anxiety, Fibromyalgia and more. 
        </p>
          <p>Eileen and her team of teachers have trained  over 1500 students worldwide  in how to utilize Biofield Tuning in their own healing practices, and these practitioners and their clients are experiencing the same profound benefits Eileen experienced in her own practice. As a dynamic and inspiring speaker,  Eileen presents internationally on biofield science, therapeutic sound, consciousness, electricity and plasma, and human health and potential.
