      <p>Controversial bestselling author Graham Hancock has spent his life at the edge. Whether he was reporting the Somali-Ethiopian war of 1977 from the front lines and giving <i>the London Sunday Times</i> a radically different take on the news story of the day, or exploring the wild frontiers of Pakistan and Afghanistan for his first book, <i>Journey Through Pakistan</i>, published in 1982, or challenging the orthodoxy with his 1989 book <i>Lords of Poverty</i> that exposed the ugly underbelly of the multi-billion dollar foreign aid business.
        </p>
          <p>Hancocks early years as a writer were filled with adventure and a willingness to take personal risks to bring back the real story.
            </p>
            <p>In the 1980s an encounter with a monk in the war-torn Ethiopian city of Axum lit the fuse for the radical new direction that his work would take from 1989 forwards examining the hidden mysteries of the human past. The result of that Ethiopian encounter led to deep research into Ethiopias claim to possess the lost Ark of the Covenant and the publication in 1992 of Hancocks first book of historical investigation, <i>The Sign and the Seal: A Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant.</i></p>
            <p>In 1995 <i>Fingerprints</i> of the Gods followed. Perhaps Hancocks best-known book, it presents the case for a lost advanced civilization of prehistoric antiquity. Although attacked and vilified by archaeologists and their friends in the media, <i>Fingerprints</i> captured the public imagination and inspired millions to think for themselves about the mysteries of the human past rather than simply and uncritically accepting what the so-called experts claim to be true. In this tradition Hancock has gone on to publish numerous other books exploring the lost civilization mystery, of which the latest is <i>Magicians of the Gods (2015).</i></p>
            <p>His next book, <i>America Before</i>, will be published in 2019 and presents shattering new evidence that rips out the rug from under establishment views of the prehistory of the Americas and brings his quest to rewrite history to a conclusion</p>
            <p>Hancocks 2005 book <i>Supernatural</i> explores humanitys ancient relationship with visionary plants. While researching this book he travelled to the Amazon rainforest and encountered  spiritual for the first time.It was a life-changing experience and the beginning of a long relationship with the Vine of Souls, but once again it has made him a hate figure with the establishment as the controversy around the banning of his 2013 TED talk, The War on Consciousness has demonstrated.

        <h3>
          AMERICA BEFORE: THE KEY TO EARTH’S LOST CIVILIZATION 
        </h3>
        <p>
          Stunning new archaeological discoveries in North America, notably in California and the Mississippi Valley, and in South America, notably in the Amazon rainforest, together with new genetic evidence, have launched a revolution in our understanding of the remote past of our species and of the origins of civilization.</p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>
<br>
<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>Apart from a few intriguing headlines, however, this revolution has been confined to academic conferences and the obscure pages of scientific journals, and the global public has not been well informed about the shattering implications of the latest research.</p>
<p>Until very recently it was believed that the Americas were amongst the last great landmasses on earth to have been inhabited by humans – who were thought to have arrived exclusively on foot from northeast Asia around 13,000 years ago by crossing the Bering Straits which formed a land bridge during the lowered sea-levels of the Ice Age. By contrast, anatomically modern humans, originating in Africa, are believed to have reached Europe, Asia, and even Australia, as far back as 60,000 years ago.</p>
<p>We now know that something of immense importance is missing from this long-established picture, and that the Americas were first peopled more than 130,000 years ago – many tens of thousands of years before human settlements became established elsewhere. Yet because of the dominance of the former – and now entirely discredited – theory of the late peopling of the Americas, and of mental blocks associated with that theory, scientists for too long focused only on the ‘Old World’ in their search for the origins of civilization and have not considered the revolutionary possibility that those origins might in fact be found in the ‘New World’.</p>
<p>
  Was a technologically and spiritually advanced civilization destroyed in the global cataclysm that ended the last Ice Age? Graham Hancock, the internationally bestselling author whose controversial take on the past, once anathema to archaeologists, has been overwhelmingly vindicated by recent discoveries, has made it his life’s work to find out — and in this talk he draws on the latest archaeological and DNA evidence to bring his quest to an astonishing conclusion.</p>
<p>Hancock’s research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the scientists responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs in this nuanced story.</p>
<p>From the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon rain forest, ancient ‘New World’ cultures share a legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual beliefs with supposedly unconnected ‘Old World’ cultures. Hancock follows the clues to their source in the devastated heartland of the lost civilization.</p>
<p>Hancock’s 2019 New York Times top ten nonfiction bestseller America Before rewrites American history as we know it and is the culmination of everything that millions of readers have loved in Hancock’s body of work over the past decades, namely a mind-dilating exploration of the mystery of ancient civilizations, amazing archaeological discoveries and profound implications for how we lead our lives today</p>
