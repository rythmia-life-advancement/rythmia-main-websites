      <p>Dr. Mario Martinez is a US clinical neuropsychologist who specializes in how cultural beliefs affect health and longevity. He proposes, based on mindbody research evidence, that longevity is learned and the causes of health are inherited.
        </p>
          <p>He has studied healthy centenarians (100 years or older) worldwide and found that only 20 to 25% can be attributed to genetics â€“ the rest is related to how they live, and the cultural beliefs they share. Dr. Martinez is the author of the bestselling book The MindBody Code: How to Change the Beliefs that Limit Your Health, Longevity, and Success that teaches his theory and practice of biocognitive science to the general public.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to longevity, he teaches in his latest bestseller, The MindBody Self: How Longevity is Learned and the Causes of Health Are Inherited, why our immune system is not just a protector. Instead, it responds to the cultural premises we learn to perceive the world.</p>

  <p>As a cultural neuropsychologist, I have researched the mindbody effects of  spiritual, mescaline, and other Ancient wisdoms to teach participants how to implement desired change from altered states of consciousness as well as to minimize negative interpretations during the Ancient wisdom experience.</p>
<p>Using Tibetan lucid dreaming techniques and archetypal neuropsychology, participants will learn how to psychologically prepare for the Ancient wisdom experience, navigate the Ancient wisdom experience, and benefit from the acquired knowledge after the Ancient wisdom experience.</p>
