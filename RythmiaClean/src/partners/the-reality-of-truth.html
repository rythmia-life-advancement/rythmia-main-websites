          The Reality of Truth offers the viewer a front-row seat on an around-the-world exploration of how people, groups and entire cultures tap into an alternative, “true reality” through spirituality, meditation and alternative medicine.

Large groups of people live free of violence and judgment. All connected on a higher, free-will, loving plane. This film showcases how these people live their lives in the truest and purest form of reality. A reality free of fraud, lies, apprehension and insecurities; where people live and behave, without society’s limits.

This film will allow you to understand how you can achieve this very way of life in the purest of forms.
