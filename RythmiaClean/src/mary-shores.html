      <p>20 years ago, Mary Shores started with an idea. Today, she is a successful entrepreneur with a multi-million-dollar, heart-centered business and a best-selling Hay House book, Conscious Communications.</p>
          <p>But she didn’t start that way. Mary hit rock-bottom after enduring the loss of her daughter and surviving an unstable past, but found within herself the strength to rebuild by founding an industry-changing business. She now inspires others with lessons of resiliency and empowerment nationwide.</p>
