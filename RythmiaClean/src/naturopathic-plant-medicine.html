<p>The guided Ancient wisdom experience is included in every guest’s stay while at Rythmia. Naturopathic medicine has been used for thousands of years, in countless cultures, to help humans heal, grow, learn, and better understand the world around them. Now western science is finding that Ancient wisdoms have the capacity to heal emotional, physical, and spiritual ailments, restore mental functionality, and guide develop spirituality, purpose and lasting happiness.
Rythmia’s groundbreaking Ancient wisdom program is administered under the direction of a physician in the safest, most comfortable and attentive conditions possible. Once guests are cleared to participate in the program, they are taught and prepared on how to resolve any internal “blocks” serving as barriers to happiness and physical well being. The Ancient wisdom experience and results are based on participant’s willingness to change and ability to be open to the healing benefits of the medicine as led by master Ancient wisdom healers and guides including Taita Juanito, Tara Boyce, and Brad Recktenwall.
</p>
<p>A Ancient wisdom experience is truly personal, deeply significant, and emotionally powerful for those who participate. During the process, you will know greater self awareness and connection to your inner self. The Ancient wisdoms will empower you in resolving past traumas, removing mental and emotional blocks, and understanding the significance of certain events that have occurred in your life. Ancient wisdom will help you move ahead in your life in a meaningful, purpose ­driven, and healthy way which enables personal success and happiness.
