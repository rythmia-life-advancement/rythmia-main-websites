        <h3>
        MOLECULES, MIRACLES, HEART AND BREATH – ANCIENT KEYS TO HEALING, MASTERY AND FREEDOM
        </h3>
        <p>The better we know ourselves, the better equipped we are to embrace the challenges that life brings our way. It’s this simple fact that lies at the core of this new program:<b>Molecules, Miracles, Heart and Breath.</b></p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>
<br>
<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>We live our lives, choose our relationships, and solve our problems based upon the way we think of ourselves. New discoveries ranging from human evolution and genetics to the new science of neuro-cardiology (the bridge between the brain and the heart) have overturned 150 years of thinking when it comes to the way we see ourselves in the world. Now we know that we’re “wired” for extraordinary abilities that have appeared rare and mystical in the past.</p>
<p><b>We also know that each person has a unique

  key that unlocks their personal code of potential.</b></p>
<p>The best science of today paves the way to do just that, and leads us directly to advanced states of consciousness that are the doorway to resolving deep, and often subconscious trauma, as well as the physical benefits that accompany such a re-set, including the awakening of a super-enhanced immune system, anti-aging enzymes, and much, much more!</p>
<p>In this fast-paced, highly visual and experiential program, New York Times best-selling author, scientist and visionary, Gregg Braden, goes beyond the mainstream thinking to reveal the discoveries that have reversed a century of thinking when it comes to us, our limits and capabilities. Join Gregg in this unique program customized to support the extended breathwork week offered by the <b>Rythmia</b> staff.</p>
<p>Gregg Braden will be teaching a 3 hour workshop on Monday, and a 90 minute work shop on Wednesday.</p>
