          LIFE IS A PLAYGROUND
        </h3>
        <p>This workshop will both entertain you and change how you experience life by uncovering all of the unconscious illusions that keep us tied to the limited story of our past. Kyle will guide you through the art of allowing and letting go and into the unlimited art of playing.</p>

  <p>You are a brilliant, creative genius. Every voice in your head that that might tell you anything other than that is a lie you’ve been told by the world that has made you forget what you actually are. This workshop will be about that.</p>
<p>Like all of Kyle’s live talks, this workshop will be completely unscripted, improvised and fully interactive. Kyle has no idea what’s going to happen, which means the space is open for even bigger things to unfold than any of our minds can see right now.</p>
