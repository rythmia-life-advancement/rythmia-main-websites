        Ron is a highly decorated Fighter Pilot and Test Pilot, Explorer,
        Entrepreneur, and Humanitarian. Ron’s military decorations include the
        Distinguished Flying Cross for combat valor during Operation Desert
        Storm. He is a graduate of both the US Air Force Fighter Weapons School
        (the Air Force version of Navy Top Gun) and the US Naval Test Pilot
        School. He also served as an instructor pilot at the US Air Force
        Fighter Weapons School.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ron is a highly decorated NASA astronaut who has traveled 71,075,867
        miles in 2,842 orbits of our planet during more than 178 days in space
        and over 27 hours of EVA during four spacewalks. He flew on both the US
        Space Shuttle and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Ron is also an aquanaut
        and participated in the joint NASA-NOAA, NEEMO-9 mission, an exploration
        research mission held in Aquarius, the world’s only undersea research
        laboratory. During this mission, he and the crew spent 18 continuous
        days living and working on the ocean floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ron’s last NASA assignment was in NASA's Open Innovation Initiative,
        which seeks to increase openness, transparency, collaboration, and
        innovation within government. In this capacity, Ron has been involved in
        many global mass collaboration and citizen science programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ron believes that a perspective of our world that he calls the “Orbital
        Perspective” has profound implications for how we experience reality,
        how we solve our biggest challenges, and how we treat each other and the
        planet. Since leaving NASA Ron has been using various platforms to use
        this "Orbital Perspective" to inspire people to improve life on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside his work with the US government, Ron is also a serial
        entrepreneur and has founded multiple charitable organizations, business
        enterprises, and social-impact-focused startups including Manna Energy
        Ltd. which was created to leverage the carbon market to finance
        humanitarian projects in developing countries. Manna Energy Ltd. is the
        first organization in the world to successfully register a United
        Nations Clean Development Mechanism carbon credit program for water
        treatment. These efforts have provided access to clean water to millions
        of people in sub-Saharan Africa. Ron also led a commercial spaceflight
        company providing revolutionary access to our planet’s upper atmosphere.
