        <h3>
          DANCE OF LIBERATION
        </h3>
        <p>A seven-step, life-changing program – a Soul Map designed to awaken joy, freedom, and a grounded, embodied consciousness in all of its participants. The Experience offers a template for living with somatic awareness, exuberance, confidence, and a sense of purpose.</p>
        <p>Dance of Liberation™ is a powerful combination of <a href="https://adta.org/2014/11/08/what-is-dancemovement-therapy/">movement therapy</a> and ceremony, rooted in ancient shamanic tradition that clears blockages in the body, mind, heart, and spirit. Integrating the Seven Foundations as a spiritual map, the experience allows dancers and non-dancers alike to explore their relationship to pain and the shadow, and <a href="https://layoga.com/practice/spirituality/sweat-as-prayer-my-urban-sweat-lodge/">learn how to work with the body</a> to release them and get in touch with the fundamental elements of what it is to be human.</p>
<p>Discover the fiery lights of your authentic self and dance to the rhythms of your liberated spirit. This powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations and allow their innermost creative sides to break free.</p>
