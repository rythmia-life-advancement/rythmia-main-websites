        <h3>
          DANCE OF LIBERATION AND EMBODIED AYURVEDIC SELF-CARE
        </h3>
        <p>This experiential self-actualization workshop will allow participants to practice embodied techniques from the healing traditions of Ayurveda and Dance of Liberation™ to support greater self-love, self-care, and the ability to be at home and free in the body.</p>

  <p>Dance of Liberation™ is a powerful combination of <a href="https://adta.org/2014/11/08/what-is-dancemovement-therapy/">movement therapy</a> and ceremony, rooted in ancient shamanic tradition that clears blockages in the body, mind, heart, and spirit. Integrating the Seven Foundations as a spiritual map, the experience allows dancers and non-dancers alike to explore their relationship to pain and the shadow, and <a href="https://layoga.com/practice/spirituality/sweat-as-prayer-my-urban-sweat-lodge/">learn how to work with the body</a> to release them and get in touch with the fundamental elements of what it is to be human.</p>
<p>Dance helps us move between power and vulnerability, struggle and ease, control and chaos, opening one up to the ongoing, never-ending conversation between mind, spirit, and body.</p>
<p>Ayurveda is one of the ancient mind-body-spirit healing disciplines from India. It is  a powerful integrative framework for navigating health and wellness that offers an empowering owner’s manual for self-inquiry and healing.</p>
