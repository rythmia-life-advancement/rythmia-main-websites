          YOU ARE ENOUGH -UNLEASHING THE REAL YOU
        </h3>
        <p>We are all running from something. Suppressing our fears. Hiding from our emotions. Trying to escape from the habits, patterns and behaviors that limit our best life. We’ve been massively fooled into believing that the solution to our challenges lie somewhere out there in a better partner, a new job, a fast-track diet and exercise program, or a higher bank balance.</p>

  <p>But nothing could be further from the truth. Panache Desai—an internationally best-selling author and visionary thought leader in the area of human development who has appeared on Super Soul Sunday with Oprah Winfrey— calls on us to find the answers we’ve been searching for by turning inward, and reclaiming the greatest truth of all… YOU ARE ENOUGH!</p>
<p>Panache brings the You Are Enough Experience to Rythmia so that you may receive the groundbreaking wisdom, tools, support, and the hands-on transformative energy to move you beyond limitation and align you with your limitless nature. If you’re ready to move out of addiction, victimhood, self-limiting beliefs, and survival into the next expression of who you are here to be, then this is the experience for you.</p>
