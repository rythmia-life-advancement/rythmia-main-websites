        <h3>
        THE ENERGY CODES OF SELF HEALING AND LIFE MASTERY
        </h3>
        <p>An experiential workshop on the “How To’s” of managing creative and healing energy in the body.  In 30 years of healing work in private practice, Dr. Sue codified what patients did to naturally heal.</p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>

<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>In this engaging and awe-inspiring workshop, Dr. Sue masterfully demonstrates the two energy systems that run the body and teaches you to move them into alignment with simple to do techniques.  She offers a Quantum shift of understanding how to master your ability to self-heal and to manifest your true destiny with ease and grace.</p>
<p>Dr. Sue is a Master Teacher of the Bio Energetic Synchronization Technique (B.E.S.T.), a powerful natural healing modality developed by her father that is taught to healthcare professionals globally.</p>
<p>Dr. Sue could see energy as a child and shut down her ability in her teens as it generated conflict in a world that did not have similar connection with the subtle energy realm. After years of not being able to retrieve that ability, it spontaneously returned during a life changing re-awakening during meditation.</p>
<p>After spending more than a decade learning how to generate the neuro-circuitry to recreate that experience at will, she now shares those skills with others, teaching them how to “Get beneath the story of their lives and work with the pure and raw energy that moves through the body to enhance the full expression of their true magnificence.”  We learn to manage our lives by managing our natural flow of energy at the body’s healing core.</p>
<p>The techniques are simple to learn and easy to do. No experience is required, because everyone is fully equipped, and everyone is welcome.</p>
