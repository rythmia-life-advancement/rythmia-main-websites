      <p>Janet is the co-author of the New York Times Bestsellers, “The Passion Test- The Effortless Path To Discovering Your Life Purpose”, and “Your Hidden Riches – Unleashing the Power of Ritual to Create A Life of Meaning and Purpose.”</p>
          <p></p>
            <p>As an expert on what it takes to live a passionate life, she has presented her programs as a featured speaker to hundreds of thousands of people around the world with The Dalai Lama, Sir Richard Branson, T. Harv Eker, Jack Canfield, Marci Shimoff, Yehuda Berg, Lisa Nichols, Brendon Burchard and other’s.</p>
            <p>Janet is the founder for The Passion Test Certification Program, The PT For Business, The PT for Kids n Teens, and The Passion Test for Homeless.</p>
            <p>Janet has personally trained over 2000 Passion Test Facilitators in over 64 countries. For her ongoing work with the homeless and kids in lockdown, Janet received the highest award for service from the President of the United States, “The Presidents Volunteer Service Award”</p>

            <p>Debra began transforming lives in the 1970’s when she studied at the feet of the greatest spiritual masters of the east – often in deep meditation for 10 to 12 hours a day and complete silence for weeks at a time – and then taught meditation to thousands.</p>
            <p>In the 1980’s Debra immersed herself in the knowledge of the Masters of western metaphysical thought and founded Yes to Success Seminars bringing what was then considered radical ideas like “your thoughts create your reality” into the mainstream.</p>
            <p>Within a few short years, Debra’s seminars were being taught in cities across the US and in seven countries on four – continents before the days of the Internet. Debra appeared regularly in the press and on radio and TV around the world.</p>
            <p>As a sought-after trainer, her clients included McDonnell Douglas, Mattel Toys, and the Xerox Management Group – at a time when it was practically unheard of for women to be doing trainings in corporate America.</p>
            <p>Using the knowledge they learned from Debra, her students went on to become mega-successful entrepreneurs, NY Times bestselling authors, millionaires, billionaires – even household names.</p>
            <p>In 1988, at the height of her success, about to launch her own national TV talk-show, Debra walked away from her career and disappeared from the public eye for over 20 years when she chose to follow a different passion – to be a full-time stay-at-home mom.</p>
            <p>Now a best selling author, world renowned speaker, and the co-founder of Your Year of Miracles mentoring program for women, with thousands of students from over 70 countries around the world, Debra has taken the idea of success to a whole new level as she now teaches how to live in alignment with your highest truth and as the YOU that you incarnated on earth to be.</p>
