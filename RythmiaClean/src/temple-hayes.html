          FROM DISCONNECTED AND DRAINED TO ENERGIZED AND IMPASSIONED
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dear Friends,
          
          Thank you for coming on this journey with me through these eight steps to stop dying every day and start living awake and present.</p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>

<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>My goal is for you to learn new tools and practices, to find new symbols, to rewrite your story, and to find your unique one-and-only creation story.</p> 
<p>When Did You Die is actually a metaphor for how to open your heart. The little deaths we feel every day lead to a tightened heart, and the way to true bliss and to the riches given to us is through an open heart.</p>
<p>I had to learn I was dying a bit every day before I could find how to embody the truth with an open heart the only way to feeling, to loving, and to giving beyond what I ever knew I could feel, love, and give. This is the essence of what it means to be both human and divine.</p>
<p>This is not about being a victim or taking on responsibility that is not ours; this is the way to reach the well of unconditional love deep inside every one of us. Therein lies the treasure.</p>
