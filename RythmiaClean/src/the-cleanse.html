<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<h2>What's the colon?</h2>
<li>The colon is the final part of the digestive tract extending from the cecum to the anus. It is about 6 feet long and a healthy colon has an average diameter of 2.5 inches. The inner lining of the colon is equipped with sensitive nerves and glands that aid in the assimilation of food, especially vitamins, minerals and water. These glands also help to eliminate body waste from the system. In the presence of healthy intestinal bacteria, certain vitamins are made and then absorbed. The colon has been referred to as the sewer system of the body. It is the place where we store the waste material that we would rather not think about. Most of us are not concerned with our health especially our colon until it becomes poor or we feel constipated or have diarrhea.</li>
<h2>What's colon hydrotherapy?</h2> 
<li>Colon hydrotherapy is the safest and most effective parasite colon cleanse available. The open water gravity-fed colon hydrotherapy treatment offered at Rythmia is much safer and easier than a common enema.</li>     
<h2>How does a colon hydrotherapy compare to an enema?</h2>
<li>An enema only reaches the rectum and lower part of the colon, whereas with colon hydrotherapy the entire length of the colon is reached and it is many more times effective. According to learned centenarian Dr. Norman Walker, “One colon irrigation is equivalent to 30 enemas.”</li>      
<h2>Do the treatments hurt?</h2>      
<li>Many people report their colon hydrotherapy sessions as being both refreshing and relaxing. You may experience stomach pains in the beginning while your body adjusts to the process.</li>
<h2>How much of the intestines are actaully cleansed during a colon hydrotherapy treatment</h2>      
<li>It is possible to cleanse the entire length of the colon during a professionally administered session. The small intestine is not specifically involved; however, the small intestine may be cleansed with the help of an oral intestinal cleanser.</li>
<h2>How long does a session take?</h2>
<li>Actual session time is 2 hours per day.</li>      
<h2>does having a menstural period at the time of a colon hydrotherapy session have any effect on the experience?</h2>      
<li>No. Some consider it a good time to have a session since your body is already cleansing. Your flow will not interfere with the success of the session. However, some women prefer to wait until after their period is over to do a cleansing session.</li>
<h2>What should I do to prepare for a colon hydrotherapy cleanse?</h2>  
<li>Refrain from eating about 2 hours before the cleanse.</li>    
<h2>Will I experience any intestinal discomfort or fatigue after the cleansing? </h2>      
<li>Usually not, but everyone is different. Some report a slight feeling of tiredness, but this is similar to the feeling you have after exercising vigorously. After a session, sipping warm liquids is usually very soothing. If you have concerns, consult with your colon hydrotherapist.</li>
<h2>Will I be left alone during a colon hydrotherapy session?</h2>      
<li>No. A certified Dead Sea Cleanse practitioner will be monitoring you throughout the session for both your comfort and safety.</li>
