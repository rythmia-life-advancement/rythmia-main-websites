        <h3>TECHNOLOGY OF SOUL, AWAKENING UNLIMITED POWER</h3>
        <p>
          We are a technology-based society, and our lives move fast along the information highway. The screens before us occupy massive amounts of time each day of our lives. Yet inside of each of us resides a powerful technology that is at our fingertips and is as close as our very breath.
        </p>
        <a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>
<br><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>This technology is the unlimited power of our inner wisdom and when activated can alter our lives and ultimately change the world. In this time of human history, it is vital for our inner technology, the path of spiritual wisdom, to be activated and engaged in our daily affairs. To create a balanced world, we as awakened beings can choose to live with full access to inner and outer technology and create a world that honors all.</p>
