      <p>Jordan River is the creator of Spirit Science, starting with the original cartoon series back in 2011, after many years of learning animation as a hobby since he was 12.</p>
          <p>The original intention behind Spirit Science was “Wow! If everyone knew this stuff, the world would change overnight!” – which emerged after Jordan experienced a profound spiritual awakening at the end of 2010.</p>
            <p>Spirit Science was his way to share his exploration with the world in an open hearted way.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Spirit Science has evolved and grown in many different ways, amassing millions of subscribers and followers from around the world. With the help of some very wise teachers, mentors, and the amazing Ancient wisdom ceremonies at Rythmia – Jordan has taken Spirit Science to a new level, with a global team working hard to produce new content for the world on a weekly basis!</p>

        <h3>
          RETURN OF THE GODDESS 
        </h3>
        <p>What an exciting time to be alive! We are rediscovering our ancient roots and the spiritual heritage that was left behind us. We are finding that in ancient times, the divine feminine played such a critical role in our spiritual traditions, just as much as the masculine.</p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>
<br>
<div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>The ancient Egyptians once had a very significant matriarchal society at one point, and even the early Christian and Greek Mysteries (such as Gnostics) worshipped the feminine aspects of God along with the masculine. They called it “The Christ Sophia”, speaking to the wisdom of the feminine heart.</p>
<p>In this special workshop, we will be exploring the deep roots of this history, how the feminine was written out of history, and what happens when it is reborn again within us today.</p>
