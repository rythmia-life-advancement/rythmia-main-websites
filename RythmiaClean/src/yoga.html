            Yoga is a discipline for one’s mental and physical health and spiritual development through its tandem use of exercise and meditative practice. The yogic practice is a tool for transformation. Rythmia is so dedicated to this part of the program that we have mindfully designed and built a yoga temple to support the practice. Classes are held every morning (except Friday). We provide mats, bolsters and pillows so you don’t have to travel with yours. The practice of yoga is a vital part of the everyday activities at Rythmia and we encourage all guests to take advantage to keep their body, mind and spirit in balance.</p>
