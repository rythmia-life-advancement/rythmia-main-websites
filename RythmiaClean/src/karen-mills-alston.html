          <p>In her book series, 10 Principles for a Life Worth Living she shares the rich legacy of three generations of women who have devoted their lives to spiritual principles and practices and proving their practical application in their lives.</p>
          <p>After graduating from the University of Southern California with a degree in political science, Karen soon became a lobbyist for the City of Los Angeles where she influenced state legislation, an experience that nourished her humanitarian zeal to positively impact the larger community and society as a whole. She later lobbied for the Airport Transport Association, along with being the Regional Government Vice President for Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines, respectively.</p>
          <p>In time, Karen became the wife and CAO to one of the most well known motivational speakers, John W. Alston, until he passed away in 2011. 10 Principles for a Life Worth Living is her tribute to their mutual commitment and work of assisting individuals in actualizing their calling in life, grounded in immutable spiritual principles and practices. Of their adult daughter, Lindsay, Karen says, “Every day she reminds me how easy it is to love. And it is that spirit of love I offer to my readers in my book series.”</p>
          <p>Today, Karen serves on the Agape International Spiritual Center’s Board of Trustees. She was recently appointed by the Board of Trustees as the Interim Dean of Agape University. Karen is also the coordinator for Agape Ministries; an instructor of its Practitioner Student Studies; and Director of Agape’s annual Revelation Conference. She serves in these capacities as a volunteer. As an Agape Licensed Spiritual Practitioner (ALSP), she has a robust clientele that enthusiastically studies and practices the teachings found in 10 Principles for a Life Worth Living.</p>
