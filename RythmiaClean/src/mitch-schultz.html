      <p>From an early age, Mitch’s curiosity of the unknown universe forged his path into storytelling and research. His work as a transmedia producer, experienced designer, and educator explores the inherent connections among consciousness, nature, culture, and the evolving human mythology.</p>
          <p>In the early ‘90s the confluence of art, information, and technology became the perfect storm for the germination of ideas that continue to inspire Mitch today.</p>
            <p>My academic research at UT Austin and New York University focused on communication theory, information technology, and media production.</p>
            <p>During his education he mentored with visionary producer Tommy Pallotta on films  such as Waking Life, music videos (Destiny, In the Waiting Line), and the interactive sci-fi mystery Amnesia Moon.</p>
            <p>In 2003 he launched Spectral Alchemy as a creative interface for his work over the next decade in indie/studio development, broadcast, interactive design, and commercial production.</p>
            <p>In 2009 Mitch decided to focus exclusively on his personal creative vision. As a result, his first documentary, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, premiered two years later and became an instant cult classic. The DMTRMX project, an open source media library and emergent storyworld, became the inspiration for MYTHAPHI.</p>
            <p>Mitch’s ongoing curiosity of the future and academic musings on cultural evolution have led to speaking appearances at conferences such as Bioneers and SXSW, universities, Burning Man and nonprofits (IONS) across North & South America, Europe and Australia (OoC Tour).</p>
            <p>In 2016 Mitch co-founded the ONE Series – a forum for discussions with visionaries exploring the edge – hosted monthly at Ludlow House in New York City.</p>

        <h3>
          ‘O​PEN SOURCE REALITY: THE EMERGENCE OF THE META-MYTH’
        </h3>
        <p>As complexity continues grow, the evolution of consciousness imparts new relationships to our understanding of reality, revealing the emergence of a new human story.</p>
          <!--- the readmore ---><a onclick="showM1()">Read More</a>
<br>
<!----><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>Let’s explore an open source approach to humanity’s collective knowledge, and remix our narratives to create deeply layered allegories that recontextualize reality. How can we imagine an evolving meta-myth that influences systemic change through transmedia storytelling?</p>
<p>Language governs all facets of life, but embodies more than the written and spoken word. It manifests through the conscious and unconscious mind, represented as numbers, played as music, coded as digital software, and much more. So, how do we shed light on some of the inadequacies inherent in our current consciousness model and provide alternates?</p>
<p>Let’s re-code the matrix through active participation and questioning reality. How, what and why is it happening? What is the link between consciousness, nature, and language?</p>
<p>How can we encourage shifts in perspective and enhance our collective ability to communicate with the Universe? I suggest that we be curious, ask questions, trust our instincts, and rewrite the rules before we know them. Play with the malleable world. We can then move toward mysticism, wisdom and practicality existing in harmony.</p>
