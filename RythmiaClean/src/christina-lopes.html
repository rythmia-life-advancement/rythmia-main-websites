<br><div id="showMore1" style="display: none;">
  <p>On the journey of awakening, one must eventually come face to face with the aspects of ourselves that are hidden and buried deep within us. Without this conscious awareness, we cannot truly heal and release our past in order to move into a happier future. But for so many of us, confronting our “demons” feels scary and impossible, as if our pain were somehow stronger than our ability to heal.</p>
  <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn how to become aware of what’s known as “your shadow” and how to heal it in a spiritually mature way, without bypassing. You’ll also discover to accelerate your shadow work and how to effectively use your time at Rythmia as a catalyst for healing your shadow.</p>
